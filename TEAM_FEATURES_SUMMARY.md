## üî® Required Database Setup

Run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
-- Create storage bucket for team files
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('team-files', 'team-files', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Set up RLS policies for the bucket
CREATE POLICY "Team members can upload files"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'team-files' AND
  auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
);

CREATE POLICY "Team members can view files"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'team-files');

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own files"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'team-files' AND
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);
```
