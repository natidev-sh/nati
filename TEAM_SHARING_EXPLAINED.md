# 🤝 Team App Sharing - How It Works

## 💡 The Big Idea

**Think of it like sharing a Google Doc link - not copying the entire document!**

When you share an app with your team, you're sharing **information about the app**, not the actual files.

---

## ✅ What IS Shared (Metadata)

### **App Reference Information:**
- ✅ **App name** - "React Dashboard"
- ✅ **App path** - Where it's located on your machine
- ✅ **GitHub repo** - Link to the repository
- ✅ **Desktop app ID** - Internal reference
- ✅ **Team context** - Which team can see it
- ✅ **Shared by** - Who shared it
- ✅ **When shared** - Timestamp

### **Purpose:**
This lets team members know:
- **"Hey, we're working on this app"**
- **"It's called React Dashboard"**
- **"Here's the GitHub repo"**
- **"You can fork/clone it here"**

---

## ❌ What is NOT Shared (Security!)

### **Your Local Files:**
- ❌ Source code files
- ❌ Node_modules
- ❌ Build artifacts
- ❌ Local database
- ❌ Configuration files

### **Sensitive Data:**
- ❌ API keys
- ❌ Environment variables (.env)
- ❌ Passwords
- ❌ Secrets
- ❌ Private tokens
- ❌ Database credentials

### **Personal Data:**
- ❌ Your file system
- ❌ Your local changes
- ❌ Your git history
- ❌ Your uncommitted work

## 🔄 How Team Collaboration Works

### **Scenario: Building a React App Together**

#### **Step 1: Team Lead Shares**

```
Team Lead:
1. Creates React app locally
2. Pushes to GitHub: github.com/team/react-app
3. Shares app with team in nati.dev

What gets shared:
✅ App name: "React Dashboard"
✅ GitHub: github.com/team/react-app
✅ Path: /Users/lead/projects/react-app
✅ Team: Frontend Team

What DOESN'T get shared:
❌ The actual files
❌ API keys in .env
❌ Local database
```

#### **Step 2: Team Member Sees It**

```
Team Member opens desktop app:

Sidebar shows:
👥 Team Shared Apps (1)
   └─ React Dashboard
      From: Frontend Team
      
Clicks on it:
→ If they have the app locally: Opens it ✅
→ If they don't: Goes to Teams page to see details
```

#### **Step 3: Team Member Clones**

```
Team Member (Desktop Teams page):
1. Sees shared app details
2. Clicks "View Repo" → Opens GitHub
3. Clicks "Fork Repo" → Forks to their account
4. Clones locally:
   git clone https://github.com/their-username/react-app
5. Now they have the code!
```

#### **Step 4: Collaboration**

```
All Team Members:
✅ Have the same codebase (from GitHub)
✅ Can see who's working on what (nati.dev)
✅ Can communicate about the project
✅ Each has their own environment
✅ Each has their own API keys
✅ Work independently, sync through Git
```

## 🎯 Real-World Use Cases

### **Use Case 1: Onboarding New Developer**

**Problem:** New dev joins, needs to know what projects team is working on

**Solution:**
```
Team Lead:
→ Shares all active projects with team

New Developer:
→ Opens desktop app
→ Sees all shared apps in sidebar
→ Knows exactly what to work on
→ Has GitHub links to clone
→ Can get started immediately
```

### **Use Case 2: Microservices Team**

**Problem:** Team has 5 different services, hard to track

**Solution:**
```
Backend Team:
→ Share: Auth Service, User Service, Payment Service, Notification Service, API Gateway

All Developers:
→ See all 5 services in sidebar
→ Know GitHub repos for each
→ Can quickly fork/clone what they need
→ Better visibility into architecture
```

### **Use Case 3: Client Project**

**Problem:** Multiple developers working on client's Next.js app

**Solution:**
```
Project Manager:
→ Shares: "Acme Corp Website"
→ Links GitHub: github.com/company/acme-website

Developers:
→ All see the project
→ All can fork the repo
→ Each sets up their own environment
→ Each has their own API keys
→ Coordinate through team chat
```

## 🔐 Security Model

### **What You Control:**

**Your Local Environment:**
```
Your Machine:
├── Source files (yours)
├── API keys (yours)
├── Database (yours)
├── Environment variables (yours)
└── Configuration (yours)
```

**What Team Sees:**
```
Team Members See:
├── App name ✅
├── GitHub repo ✅
├── Path reference ✅
└── Team context ✅

Team Members DON'T See:
├── Your files ❌
├── Your secrets ❌
└── Your data ❌
```

### **GitHub is the Source of Truth:**

```
GitHub Repository (Public/Team Access):
├── Source code ✅
├── README ✅
├── Setup instructions ✅
└── Public configurations ✅

NOT in GitHub (Never commit these!):
├── .env file ❌
├── API keys ❌
├── Passwords ❌
└── Secrets ❌
```

## 📋 Best Practices

### **For Team Leads:**

**1. Before Sharing:**
```
✅ Push latest code to GitHub
✅ Ensure repo is accessible to team
✅ Add good README with setup instructions
✅ Document environment variables needed
✅ Remove any hardcoded secrets
```

✅ Keep repo up to date
✅ Update shared app info if path changes
```

### **For Team Members:**

**1. When You See Shared App:**
```
✅ Check GitHub repo first
✅ Read README
✅ Fork (don't clone directly)
✅ Clone your fork
✅ Set up your own .env
```

**2. Setting Up:**
```
✅ Follow setup instructions
✅ Create your own API keys
✅ Set up your own database
✅ Test everything works
✅ Ask questions if stuck
```

**3. Working:**
```
✅ Work on your fork
✅ Commit frequently

## 🤔 Common Questions

### **Q: Can team members access my local files?**
**A:** No! Only metadata is shared. Your files stay on your machine.

### **Q: Can team members see my API keys?**
**A:** No! Never share API keys. Each developer has their own.

### **Q: What if I don't want to share the app anymore?**
**A:** Unshare it from the web dashboard (My Apps → Manage → Unshare).

### **Q: What if the shared app doesn't open?**
**A:** If you don't have it locally, click it to go to Teams page and fork/clone from GitHub.

### **Q: Can I share apps from desktop?**
**A:** Currently only from web (nati.dev). Desktop sharing coming soon!

### **Q: What if GitHub repo is private?**
**A:** Team members need access to the repo. Add them as collaborators or use organization.

### **Q: Does everyone need the same file path?**
**A:** No! The path shown is where the original person has it. You can clone anywhere.

### **Q: What about databases?**
**A:** Each developer sets up their own database locally. Use migrations for schema.

## 📊 What Gets Stored Where

### **Supabase (Cloud):**
```sql
team_apps table:
├── team_id (which team)
├── app_id (which app reference)
└── shared_by (who shared)

user_apps table:
├── name (app name)
├── path (file path reference)
├── github_repo (repo link)
└── desktop_app_id (local app link)
```

**NOT in Supabase:**
- Your source code
- Your API keys
- Your local files
- Your .env variables

### **GitHub (Code Host):**
```
Repository:
├── Source code ✅
├── README ✅
├── package.json ✅
└── .gitignore ✅

NOT in GitHub:
├── .env file ❌
├── node_modules ❌
└── build artifacts ❌
```

### **Your Machine (Local):**
```
Your Project:
├── Source code (cloned from GitHub)
├── .env (your own secrets)
├── node_modules (npm install)
└── local database (your data)
```

## ✅ Summary

### **What Team Sharing Does:**

**✅ Shares:**
- App name and description
- GitHub repository link
- Path reference (where you have it)
- Team context

**❌ Doesn't Share:**
- Your actual files
- Your API keys
- Your environment variables
- Your local data
- Your secrets

### **How to Use It:**

1. **Share:** Push to GitHub → Share in nati.dev
2. **See:** Open desktop app → View in sidebar
3. **Clone:** Click app → Fork repo → Clone locally
4. **Setup:** Install deps → Add your .env → Run
5. **Work:** Develop on your fork → PR to main
6. **Sync:** Keep updated from upstream

### **Think of it as:**
📋 **Like a project directory** - everyone knows what projects exist
🔗 **Like sharing links** - not copying files
👥 **Like team visibility** - know what everyone's working on
🔒 **But private** - your setup stays yours
