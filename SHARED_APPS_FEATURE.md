## 📊 What Gets Shared

When you share an app, team members see:

**✅ App Information:**
- App name
- App path (file location)
- Desktop app ID
- When it was shared
- Who shared it
- Which team it's from

**❌ Not Shared:**
- Local files (only metadata)
- API keys (keep your secrets safe!)
- Local database
- Environment variables

**📝 Note:** Team members see WHERE the app is, but don't get access to your local files. They need to have the same app locally or clone the repo.

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### **New Hook: `useSharedApps`**

```typescript
export function useSharedApps() {
  // Fetches apps shared with your teams
  // Returns: { sharedApps, loading, error, refetch }
}
```

**What it does:**
1. Gets your team memberships
2. Fetches apps shared with those teams
3. Returns formatted list of shared apps
4. Auto-refreshes when needed

### **Updated Component: `AppList.tsx`**

**Changes:**
- Added shared apps section
- Added team icon
- Added team name display
- Added visual separation

### **Database Tables Used:**

```sql
-- Your team memberships
team_members
  ├─ user_id (you)
  └─ team_id (your teams)

-- Apps shared with teams
team_apps
  ├─ team_id (which team)
  ├─ app_id (which app)
  └─ shared_by (who shared)

-- App details
user_apps
  ├─ name
  ├─ path
  └─ desktop_app_id
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### **Example 1: Frontend Team**

**Scenario:** Team working on React app

   - Opens desktop app
   - Sees shared app in sidebar
   - Can reference the app structure
   - Knows where files are located

3. **Designer (Desktop):**

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### **What's Safe:**

✅ **Metadata only** - Only app info is shared, not files
✅ **Team-based** - Only team members see shared apps
✅ **Role-based** - Permissions respected
✅ **Audit trail** - Know who shared what and when

### **Best Practices:**

1. **Only share relevant apps** - Don't over-share
2. **Use descriptive names** - Help team identify apps
3. **Keep paths accurate** - Team members need correct paths
4. **Review shared apps** - Regularly check what's shared
5. **Remove when done** - Unshare completed projects

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

```
New developer joins
→ Team lead shares all active projects
