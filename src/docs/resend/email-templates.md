# Email Templates

> Use high quality, unstyled components for your transactional emails using React and Typescript

While you can generate HTML for your emails using any method, we recommend [React Email](https://react.email/) for React developers. It makes it easy to create email templates with React and TailwindCSS.

* [Email components](https://react.email/components)
* [Email examples](https://react.email/templates)

Each example includes a preview, the React code, the rendered HTML, and the plain text version of the email.
