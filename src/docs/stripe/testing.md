# Testing

Simulate payments to test your integration.

To test your integration, simulate transactions without moving any money using special testing values in a *sandbox* (A sandbox is an isolated test environment that allows you to test Stripe functionality in your account without affecting your live integration. Use sandboxes to safely experiment with new features and changes). You can access your sandboxes using the account picker at the top right of the page or in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/sandboxes).

Test cards act as fake credit cards, and allow you to simulate the following scenarios:

- Successful payments by [card brand](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md#cards) or [country](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md#international-cards)
- Card errors due to [declines](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md#declined-payments), [fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md#fraud-prevention), or [invalid data](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md#invalid-data)
- [Disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md#disputes) and [refunds](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md#refunds)
- Authentication with [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md#regulatory-cards) and [PINs](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md#terminal)

Testing non-card payments works similarly. Non-card payments are payment methods that aren’t credit or debit cards. Stripe supports various non-card payment options, such as digital wallets and bank transfers. [Each payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md#non-card-payments) has its own special values.

Don’t use testing environments to load test your integration because you might hit [rate limits](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md#rate-limits). To load test your integration, see [load testing](https://docs.stripe.com/rate-limits.md#load-testing).

## How to use test cards 

Any time you work with a test card, use [test API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md#obtain-api-keys) in all API calls. This is true whether you’re serving a payment form to test interactively or writing test code.

> Don’t use real card details. The [Stripe Services Agreement](https://stripe.com/legal/ssa#1-your-stripe-account) prohibits testing in live mode using real payment method details. Use your test API keys and the card numbers below.

### Testing interactively

When testing interactively, use a card number, such as [4242 4242 4242 4242](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md?testing-method=card-numbers#visa).  Enter the card number in the Dashboard or in any payment form.

- Use a valid future date, such as **12/34**.
- Use any three-digit CVC (four digits for American Express cards).
- Use any value you like for other form fields.
![An example payment form showing how to enter a test card number. The card number is "4242 4242 4242 4242", the expiration date is "12/34", and the CVC is "567". Other fields have arbitrary values. For instance, the email address is "test@example.com"](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/test-card.c3f9b3d1a3e8caca3c9f4c9c481fd49c.jpg)

Testing a form interactively with the test card number 4242 4242 4242 4242

### Test code

When writing test code, use a `PaymentMethod` such as [pm_card_visa](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md?testing-method=payment-methods#visa) instead of a card number. We don’t recommend using card numbers directly in API calls or server-side code, even in testing environments. If you do use them, your code might not be PCI-compliant when you go live. By default, a `PaymentMethod` isn’t attached to a *Customer* (Customer objects represent customers of your business. They let you reuse payment methods and give you the ability to track multiple payments).

```curl

PaymentIntent paymentIntent = service.Create(options);
```

Most integrations don’t use Tokens anymore, but we make test Tokens such as [tok_visa](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md?testing-method=tokens#visa) available if you need them.

When you’re ready to take your integration live, replace your test publishable and secret [API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md) with live ones. You can’t process live payments if your integration is still using your test API keys.

## Cards by brand 

To simulate a successful payment for a specific card brand, use test cards from the following list.

> Cross-border fees are assessed based on the country of the card issuer. Cards where the issuer country isn’t the US (such as JCB and UnionPay) might be subject to a cross-border fee, even in testing environments.

  > *Strong Customer Authentication* (Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) is a regulatory requirement in effect as of September 14, 2019, that impacts many European online payments. It requires customers to use two-factor authentication like 3D Secure to verify their purchase) regulations require *3D Secure* (3D Secure (3DS) provides an additional layer of authentication for credit card transactions that protects businesses from liability for fraudulent card payments) authentication for online payments within the *European Economic Area* (The European Economic Area is a regional single market with free movement of labor, goods, and capital. It encompasses the European Union member states and three additional states that are part of the European Free Trade Association).

It requires customers to use two-factor authentication like 3D Secure to verify their purchase) regulations require *3D Secure* (3D Secure (3DS) provides an additional layer of authentication for credit card transactions that protects businesses from liability for fraudulent card payments) authentication for online payments within the *European Economic Area* (The European Economic Area is a regional single market with free movement of labor, goods, and capital. It encompasses the European Union member states and three additional states that are part of the European Free Trade Association). The test cards in this section simulate a payment that succeeds without authentication. We recommend also testing scenarios that involve authentication, using [3D Secure test cards](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md#regulatory-cards). |

## Declined payments

To test your integration’s error-handling logic by simulating payments that the issuer declines for various reasons, use test cards from this section. Using one of these cards results in a [card error](https://docs.stripe.com/error-handling.md#payment-errors) with the given [error code](https://docs.stripe.com/error-codes.md) and [decline code](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes.md).

> To simulate an incorrect CVC, you must provide one using any three-digit number. If you don’t provide a CVC, Stripe doesn’t perform the CVC check, so the check can’t fail.

## Fraud prevention

Stripe’s fraud prevention system, Radar, can block payments when they have a high risk level or fail verification checks. You can use the cards in this section to test your Radar settings. You can also use them to test how your integration responds to blocked payments.

Each card simulates specific risk factors. Your Radar settings determine which risk factors cause it to block a payment. Blocked payments result in [card errors with an error code of fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/error-handling.md).

> To simulate a failed CVC check, you must provide a CVC using any three-digit number. To simulate a failed postal code check, you must provide any valid postal code. If you don’t provide those values, Radar doesn’t perform the corresponding checks, so the checks can’t fail.

## Invalid data

To test errors resulting from invalid data, provide invalid details. You don’t need a special test card for this. Any invalid value works. For instance:

- [invalid_expiry_month](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes.md#invalid_expiry_month): Use an invalid month, such as **13**.
- [invalid_expiry_year](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes.md#invalid_expiry_year): Use a year up to 50 years in the past, such as **95**.
- [invalid_cvc](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes.md#invalid_cvc): Use a two-digit number, such as **99**.
- [incorrect_number](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes.md#incorrect_number): Use a card number that fails the [Luhn check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm), such as 4242424242424241.

## Disputes 

To simulate a [disputed transaction](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes.md), use the test cards in this section. Then, to simulate winning or losing the dispute, provide [winning or losing evidence](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md#evidence).

### Evidence 

To simulate winning or losing the dispute, respond with one of the evidence values from the table below.

- If you [respond using the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api.md), pass the value from the table as [uncategorized_text](https://docs.stripe.com/api/disputes/update.md#update_dispute-evidence-uncategorized_text).
- If you [respond in the Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding.md) or in [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/disputes-list.md), enter the value from the table in the **Additional information** field. Then, click **Submit evidence**.

| Evidence                    | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `winning_evidence`          | Closes the dispute as won and credits your account for the amount of the charge and related fees.                                                             |
| `losing_evidence`           | Closes the dispute as lost without crediting your account. For inquiries, this closes the inquiry without escalation.                                         |
| `escalate_inquiry_evidence` | Escalates the inquiry to a chargeback. This transitions the inquiry to a full dispute and debits your account for the amount of the dispute and related fees. |

## Refunds

In live mode, refunds are asynchronous: a refund can appear to succeed and later fail, or can appear as `pending` at first and later succeed. To simulate refunds with those behaviors, use the test cards in this section. (With all other test cards, refunds succeed immediately and don’t change status after that.)

You can cancel a card refund only by using the Dashboard. In live mode, you can cancel a card refund within a short but nonspecific period of time. Testing environments simulate that period by allowing you to cancel a card refund within 30 minutes.

## Available balance

To send the funds from a test transaction directly to your available balance, use the test cards in this section. Other test cards send funds from a successful payment to your pending balance.

## 3D Secure authentication 

3D Secure requires an additional layer of authentication for credit card transactions. The test cards in this section allow you to simulate triggering authentication in different payment flows.

Only cards in this section effectively test your 3D Secure integration by simulating defined 3DS behavior, such as a challenge flow or an unsupported card. Other Stripe testing cards might still trigger 3DS, but we return `attempt_acknowledged` to bypass the additional steps since 3DS testing isn’t the objective for those cards.

> #### Dashboard not supported
> 
> 3D Secure redirects won’t occur for payments created directly in the Stripe Dashboard. Instead, use your integration’s own frontend or an API call.

### Authentication and setup

To simulate payment flows that include authentication, use the test cards in this section. Some of these cards can also be [set up](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse.md) for future payments, or have already been.

### Support and availability 

Stripe requests authentication when required by regulation or when triggered by your Radar rules or custom code. Even if authentication is requested, it can’t always be performed—for instance, the customer’s card might not be enrolled, or an error might occur. Use the test cards in this section to simulate various combinations of these factors.

### 3D Secure mobile challenge flows

In a mobile payment, several challenge flows for authentication—where the customer has to interact with prompts in the UI—are available. Use the test cards in this section to trigger a specific challenge flow for test purposes. These cards aren’t useful in browser-based payment forms or in API calls. In those environments, they work but don’t trigger any special behavior. Because they’re not useful in API calls, we don’t provide any `PaymentMethod` or `Token` values to test with.

| Challenge flow    | Number           | Details                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Out of band       | 4000582600000094 | 3D Secure 2 authentication must be completed on all transactions. Triggers the challenge flow with Out of Band UI.       |
| One time passcode | 4000582600000045 | 3D Secure 2 authentication must be completed on all transactions. Triggers the challenge flow with One Time Passcode UI. |
| Single select     | 4000582600000102 | 3D Secure 2 authentication must be completed on all transactions. Triggers the challenge flow with single-select UI.     |
| Multi select      | 4000582600000110 | 3D Secure 2 authentication must be completed on all transactions. Triggers the challenge flow with multi-select UI.      |

## Captcha challenge 

To prevent fraud, Stripe might display a captcha challenge to the user on the payment page. Use the test cards below to simulate this flow.

| Description       | Number           | Details                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Captcha challenge | 4000000000001208 | The charge succeeds if the user correctly answers the captcha challenge. |
| Captcha challenge | 4000000000003725 | The charge succeeds if the user correctly answers the captcha challenge. |

## Payments with PINs 

Use the test cards in this section to simulate successful in-person payments where a PIN is involved. There are many other options for testing in-person payments, including a simulated reader and physical test cards. See [Test Stripe Terminal](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing.md) for more information.

## Event destinations 

To test your webhook endpoint or [event destination](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations.md), choose one of these two options:

1. Perform actions in a sandbox that send legitimate events to your event destination. For example, to trigger the [charge.succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api.md#event_types-charge.succeeded) event, you can use a [test card that produces a successful charge](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md#cards).
1. [Trigger events using the Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#test-webhook) or [using Stripe for Visual Studio Code](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-vscode.md#webhooks).

## Rate limits

If your requests in your testing environments begin to receive `429` HTTP errors, make them less frequently. These errors come from our [rate limiter](https://docs.stripe.com/rate-limits.md), which is more strict in testing environments than in live mode.

We don’t recommend load testing your integration using the Stripe API in testing environments. Because the load limiter is stricter in testing environments, you might see errors that you wouldn’t see in production. See [load testing](https://docs.stripe.com/rate-limits.md#load-testing) for an alternative approach.

## Non-card payments

Any time you use a test non-card payment method, use [test API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md#obtain-api-keys) in all API calls. This is true whether you’re serving a payment form you can test interactively or writing test code.

Different payment methods have different test procedures:

#### ACH Direct Debit

Learn how to test scenarios with instant verifications using [Financial Connections](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/testing.md#web-how-to-use-test-accounts).

### Send transaction emails in a sandbox

After you collect the bank account details and accept a mandate, send the mandate confirmation and microdeposit verification emails in a *sandbox* (A sandbox is an isolated test environment that allows you to test Stripe functionality in your account without affecting your live integration. Use sandboxes to safely experiment with new features and changes).

If your domain is **{domain}** and your username is **{username}**, use the the following email format to send test transaction emails: **{username}+test\_email@{domain}**.

For example, if your domain is **example.com** and your username is **info**, use the format **info+test\_email@example.com** for testing ACH Direct Debit payments. This format ensures that emails route correctly. If you don’t include the **+test\_email** suffix, we won’t send the email.

> You need to [activate your Stripe account](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate.md) before you can trigger these emails while testing.

### Test account numbers

Stripe provides several test account numbers and corresponding tokens you can use to make sure your integration for manually-entered bank accounts is ready for production.

| Account number | Token                                  | Routing number | Behavior                                                                                                                                              |

| `000777777771` | `pm_usBankAccount_weeklyLimitExceeded` | `110000000`    | The payment fails due to payment amount causing the account to exceed its weekly payment volume limit.                                                |

Before test transactions can complete, you need to verify all test accounts that automatically succeed or fail the payment. To do so, use the test microdeposit amounts or descriptor codes below.

### Test microdeposit amounts and descriptor codes

To mimic different scenarios, use these microdeposit amounts *or* 0.01 descriptor code values.

| Microdeposit values | 0.01 descriptor code values | Scenario                                                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `32` and `45`       | SM11AA                      | Simulates verifying the account.                                 |
| `10` and `11`       | SM33CC                      | Simulates exceeding the number of allowed verification attempts. |
| `40` and `41`       | SM44DD                      | Simulates a microdeposit timeout.                                |

### Test settlement behavior

Test transactions settle instantly and are added to your available test balance. This behavior differs from livemode, where transactions can take [multiple days](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md#timing) to settle in your available balance.

#### SEPA Direct Debit

Create a test `PaymentIntent` that either succeeds or fails by doing the following:

1. Create a test *PaymentMethod* (PaymentMethods represent your customer's payment instruments, used with the Payment Intents or Setup Intents APIs) with a test account number.
1. Use the resulting `PaymentMethod` in a `confirmSepaDebitPayment` request to create the test charge.

#### BACS Direct Debit

There are several [test bank account numbers](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md#test-live-modes) you can use in a *sandbox* (A sandbox is an isolated test environment that allows you to test Stripe functionality in your account without affecting your live integration. Use sandboxes to safely experiment with new features and changes) to make sure this integration is ready.

You can test using any of the account numbers provided above. However, because Bacs Direct Debit payments take several days to process, use the test account numbers that operate on a three-minute delay to better simulate the behavior of live payments.

> By default, Stripe automatically sends [emails](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/bacs-debit.md#debit-notifications) to the customer when payment details are initially collected and each time a debit will be made on their account. These notifications aren’t sent in sandboxes.

#### AU BECS Direct Debit

You can create a test `PaymentIntent` that either succeeds or fails by doing the following:

Create a test *PaymentMethod* (PaymentMethods represent your customer's payment instruments, used with the Payment Intents or Setup Intents APIs) with the test `BSB 000000` and a test account number from the list below. Use the resulting `PaymentMethod` in a `confirmAuBecsDebitPayment` request to create the test charge.

#### Others

With other payment methods, testing information is included with the documentation. [Find your payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview.md) and read the associated guide to accept and test payments.

## Link

> Don’t store real user data in *sandbox* (A sandbox is an isolated test environment that allows you to test Stripe functionality in your account without affecting your live integration. Use sandboxes to safely experiment with new features and changes) Link accounts. Treat them as if they’re publicly available, because these test accounts are associated with your publishable key.

Currently, Link only works with credit cards, debit cards, and qualified US bank account purchases. Link requires [domain registration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/pmd-registration.md).

You can create sandbox accounts for Link using any valid email address. The following table shows the fixed one-time passcode values that Stripe accepts for authenticating sandbox accounts:

| Value                               | Outcome                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Any other 6 digits not listed below | Success                      |
| 000001                              | Error, code invalid          |
| 000002                              | Error, code expired          |
| 000003                              | Error, max attempts exceeded |

### Multiple funding sources

As Stripe adds additional funding source support, you don’t need to update your integration. Stripe automatically supports them with the same transaction settlement time and guarantees as card and bank account payments.

## Redirects

To test your integration’s redirect-handling logic by simulating a payment that uses a redirect flow (for example, iDEAL), use a supported payment method that [requires redirects](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support.md#additional-api-supportability).

To create a test `PaymentIntent` that either succeeds or fails:

1. Navigate to the [payment methods settings in the Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable a supported payment method by clicking **Turn on** in your testing environment.
1. Collect payment details.
1. Submit the payment to Stripe.
1. Authorize or fail the test payment.

Make sure that the page (corresponding to `return_url`) on your website provides the status of the payment.
