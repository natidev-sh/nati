# Set up and deploy a webhook

Learn how to set up and deploy a webhook to listen to events from Stripe.

# Interactive webhook endpoint builder 

Learn how to set up and deploy a webhook endpoint to listen to events from Stripe. Use a webhook endpoint for post-payment commerce events such as sending custom email receipts, fulfilling orders, or updating your database. Do these steps in a sandbox before doing them in live mode.

```

### Create a new endpoint

A [webhook endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md) is a destination on your server that receives requests from Stripe, notifying you about events that happen on your account such as a customer disputing a charge or a successful recurring payment. Add a new endpoint to your server and make sure it’s publicly accessible so we can send unauthenticated POST requests.

### Read the event data

Stripe sends the event data in the request body. Each event is structured as an [Event object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events.md) with a `type`, `id`, and related Stripe resource nested under `data`.

### Handle the event

As soon as you have the event object, check the [type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md) to know what kind of event happened. You can use one webhook to handle several different event types at once, or set up individual endpoints for specific events.

### Return a 200 response

[Send a successful 200 response](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#handle-events-asynchronously) to Stripe as quickly as possible because Stripe retries the event if a response isn’t sent within a reasonable time. Write any long-running processes as code that can run asynchronously outside the webhook endpoint.

### Run the server

Build and run your server to test the endpoint at `http://localhost:4242/webhook`.

```bash
npm start
```

### Run the server

Build and run your server to test the endpoint at `http://localhost:4242/webhook`.

```bash
ruby server.rb
```

### Run the server

Build and run your server to test the endpoint at `http://localhost:4242/webhook`.

```bash
python3 -m flask --app server run --port=4242
```

### Run the server

Build and run your server to test the endpoint at `http://localhost:4242/public/webhook.php`.

```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:4242
```

### Run the server

Build and run your server to test the endpoint at `http://localhost:4242/webhook`.

```bash
dotnet run
```

### Run the server

Build and run your server to test the endpoint at `http://localhost:4242/webhook`.

```bash
go run server.go
```

### Run the server

Build and run your server to test the endpoint at http://localhost:4242/webhook.

```bash
java -cp target/sample-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.stripe.sample.Server
```

### Download the CLI

Use the Stripe CLI to test your webhook locally. [Download the CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli.md) and log in with your Stripe account. Alternatively, use a service like ngrok to make your local endpoint publicly accessible.

```bash
stripe login
```

### Forward events to your webhook

Set up [event forwarding](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#test-webhook) with the CLI to send all Stripe events in a sandbox to your local webhook endpoint.

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4242/webhook
```

### Forward events to your webhook

Set up [event forwarding](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#test-webhook) with the CLI to send all Stripe events in testmode to your local webhook endpoint.

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4242/public/webhook.php
```

### Simulate events

Use the CLI to [simulate specific events](https://docs.stripe.com/cli/trigger) that test your webhook application logic by sending a POST request to your webhook endpoint with a mocked Stripe event object.

```bash
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
```

### Secure your webhook

Verify the source of a webhook request to prevent bad actors from sending fake payloads or injecting SQL that modify your backend systems. Secure your webhook with a client signature to validate that Stripe generated a webhook request and that it didn’t come from a server acting like Stripe.

### Add the endpoint signing secret

Each webhook endpoint has a unique signing secret, which you can find in the [Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/webhooks) tab in Workbench. If you’re testing locally with the Stripe CLI, you can also get the signing secret from the CLI output using the command `stripe listen`.

### Verify the event

Use the Stripe library to verify and construct the event from Stripe. You need the endpoint secret, the request headers, and the raw request body to properly verify the event. Alternatively, you can [manually verify](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md?verify=verify-manually#verify-manually) the signature without having to use the Stripe library.

### Read the request signature

Each request from Stripe contains a `Stripe-Signature` header. Store a reference to this header value for later use.

### Verify the request

Use the Stripe library to verify that the request came from Stripe. Pass the raw request body, `Stripe-Signature` header, and endpoint secret to construct an [Event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/object.md).

### Handle errors

Checking for errors helps catch improperly configured webhooks or malformed requests from non-Stripe services. Common errors include using the wrong endpoint secret, passing a parsed representation (for example, JSON) of the request body, or reading the wrong request header.

### Test the endpoint

Test your secured endpoint by using the Stripe CLI, which sends the proper signature header in each test event.

// This is a public sample test API key.
// Don’t submit any personally identifiable information in requests made with this key.
// Sign in to see your own test API key embedded in code samples.
const stripe = require('stripe')('<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>');
// Replace this endpoint secret with your endpoint's unique secret
// If you are testing with the CLI, find the secret by running 'stripe listen'
// If you are using an endpoint defined with the API or dashboard, look in your webhook settings

      break;
    default:
      // Unexpected event type
      console.log(`Unhandled event type ${event.type}.`);
  }
  // Return a 200 response to acknowledge receipt of the event
  response.send();
