# Receive payouts

Set up your bank account to receive payouts.

You receive funds when Stripe (or your platform) makes payouts to your bank account. Payout availability varies depending on your industry and country of operation. When you start processing live payments, Stripe typically schedules your initial payout for 7-14 days after you successfully receive your first payment. Your first payout might take longer, depending on your industry risk level and country of operation. Subsequent payouts follow your account’s [payout schedule](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts.md#payout-schedule).

You can see a comprehensive list of your payouts and the expected dates of deposit into your bank account in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payouts). If you’re a *Connect* (Connect is Stripe's solution for multi-party businesses, such as marketplace or software platforms, to route payments between sellers, customers, and other recipients) platform, see [Connect payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-connected-accounts.md).

## Add or update your bank account 

You can update your account details or add a new bank account using the [Payout settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/payouts) in the Dashboard. Based on your bank’s location, Stripe might require different kinds of account details to activate your bank account. You must match the currency of the bank account to the currency in your [Payout settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/payouts). Click **Edit** next to the applicable bank account to modify the banking information.

### Supported bank account types 

You have the flexibility to link various types of bank accounts for your Stripe payouts. Supported options include traditional accounts offered by established financial institutions, including checking and savings accounts. Additionally, Stripe lets you use virtual bank accounts such as N26, Revolut, Wise, and others. If you’re eligible, you can also use a debit card for [instant payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts.md#instant-payouts).

> While Stripe supports non-standard bank accounts, you might see higher payout failures for these accounts.

### Supported accounts and settlement currencies 

In most cases, bank accounts must be located in the country where the *settlement currency* (The settlement currency is the currency your bank account uses) is the official currency. For example, SEK bank accounts must be based in Sweden. Stripe also allows you to settle and pay out to banks in select additional currencies, or pay out to non-domestic bank accounts in the local currency, for a fee. Learn more about [presenting and settling in multiple currencies](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/multicurrency-settlement.md).

At times, Stripe supports non-primary currencies that don’t incur a fee. See the following table for the list of supported free currencies per country:

Acquiring fees, where applicable, are based on the settlement currency. You can find these acquiring fees listed out by currency on your country’s pricing page.

### Multiple bank accounts for different settlement currencies 

In some countries, Stripe users can add extra bank accounts to enable settlements and payouts in additional currencies. You can add one bank account per supported settlement currency. If you use multiple bank accounts, you must select a default settlement currency, which you can change at any time.

Charges that are *presented* (The presentment currency is the currency the customer uses to make a payment) in any enabled settlement currency settle without [currency conversion](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies.md). However, payments presented in a currency that you haven’t configured an additional bank account for automatically convert to your default currency.

For example, consider a Stripe user in the United Kingdom who has added both GBP and USD bank accounts, with GBP selected as the default settlement currency. USD payments (where USD is the presentment currency) are automatically paid out to the USD bank account without conversion, whereas payments in all other currencies are converted into GBP.

You can manage your bank accounts and default settlement currency by visiting [Bank accounts and scheduling](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/payouts) in the Dashboard.

## Payout schedule 

All payments and payouts are processed according to [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) time [except for Asia-Pacific (APAC) markets](https://support.stripe.com/questions/default-start-of-day-for-asia-pacific-%28apac%29-payouts). As a result, the processed date might not be the same as your local time zone.

Your payout schedule determines when Stripe sends money to your bank account. You can select your preferred payout schedule during onboarding or update it any time in the Stripe Dashboard.

### Types of payout schedules

The following payout schedules are available:

- Manual payouts: You choose when to send payouts and how much to transfer.
- Daily payouts: Stripe automatically transfers your available funds every business day.
- Weekly or monthly payouts: You can specify particular days of the week or days of the month for payouts (for example, payouts on Mondays and Thursdays, or on the 1st and 15th of each month).
- Monthly adjustments: If your selected payout day doesn’t exist in a given month (for example, the 31st in a 30-day month), Stripe moves the payout to the last day of that month.
- Non-business days: Payouts that are scheduled on weekends or holidays arrive on the next business day.

### How payout timing works

Choosing a payout schedule doesn’t change how long it takes for your pending balance to become available. It only controls when payouts are sent.

For example, if your account is set to daily payouts with a 3-business-day [payout speed](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts.md#payout-speed), Stripe pays out funds daily from transactions that were captured three business days earlier.

### Country-specific payout restrictions

Some countries have preset payout schedules due to local regulations:

- Brazil and India: Payouts are always automatic and daily.
- Japan: Daily payouts aren’t available. The default schedule is manual, and weekly and monthly payout schedules are also available.
- Thailand: The default schedule is daily automatic payouts.

These restrictions don’t apply if you’re using [Cross-border payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cross-border-payouts.md).

### Manual payouts

If you turn off automatic payouts in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payouts), you must manually send funds to your bank account. You can do this either in the Dashboard or by [creating payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/api.md#create_payout) using the API. Manual payouts are available in all regions except Brazil and India, where payouts are always automatic and daily. In most regions, manual payouts typically take 1-4 business days to arrive in your bank account after initiating the manual payout.

If your Stripe account that operates in the United Kingdom has a standard [T+3 payout speed](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts.md#payout-speed) and you initiate a manual payout during business hours, the funds typically arrive in your bank account on the same business day. This same-day payout is limited to 10 same-day manual payouts per day, with a maximum transaction amount of £1 million each. All other manual payouts typically arrive within 2 business days in your bank account.

If your Stripe account that operates in the United States has a standard [T+2 payout speed](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts.md#payout-speed) and you initiate a manual payout during business hours, the funds typically arrive in your bank account on the same business day. This payout is subject to an account limit of 10 manual payouts per day and a maximum transaction amount of 1 million USD. All other manual payouts typically arrive within 1 business day in your bank account.

## Payout speed 

While payout schedule refers to the cadence your funds are paid out on (for example, day of the week), payout speed refers to the amount of time it takes for your funds to become available. The payout speed varies per country and is typically expressed as T+X days. Some payment processors might start “T” from their internal settlement time, meaning when the funds land in their bank accounts.

In Stripe, “T” refers to the transaction time, which indicates the time of the original payment confirmation or capture, and the counting starts earlier. If your Stripe account is in a country with a T+3 standard payout speed and you use a manual payout schedule, your Stripe balance is available for payout within three business days of capturing a payment. However, if you use a daily automatic payout schedule with a T+3 speed, Stripe pays out funds daily from transactions captured 3 business days earlier.

Most banks deposit payouts into your bank account as soon as they receive them, though some might take a few extra days to make them available. The type of business and the country you’re in can also affect payout timing.

### Delay behavior per account country 

As the platform, you can set [delay_days](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/manage-payout-schedule.md#delay_days) on your connected accounts. The delay applies as a **business day** or **calendar day** delay based on the country of the connected account. The following table shows which countries apply the delay by business or calendar day.

| Country                                                              | Delay type                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| AU, IN, JP, MY, NZ, TH, AE, US                                       | Business day (Monday - Friday)   |
| BR1, CA, GI, HK, LI, MX, NO, SG2, CH, GB, and supported EU countries | Calendar day (Sunday - Saturday) |

1 Delays for Pix, Boleto, debit, and prepaid payouts in Brazil apply in business days.

2 Delays for PayNow in Singapore apply in business days.

### Payout speed by country 

Use the following table to determine your country’s payout speed. The initial payout speed applies to your first payout, and the default payout speed applies to subsequent payouts.

> In some cases, risk criteria might prevent your account from changing to the default payout speed.

### Country and payout speed

## Minimum payout amounts 

The minimum payout amount depends on the lowest amount we can support with our banking partners. For example, if you’re located in the US and you have less than 1 cent (0.01 of 1 dollar) USD in your Stripe account, you must wait until you accept more payments and increase your balance before you can receive a payout. If your available account balance is less than the minimum payout amount, it remains in your Stripe account until your balance increases.

If you’re in a supported country, you can use [multi-currency settlement](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/multicurrency-settlement.md) to send a payout to your local bank accounts in a foreign currency. For example, a French user can now receive a USD payout in their French bank account instead of having to pay for multiple currency exchanges.

Minimum payout amounts are typically one base unit of the local currency. See the following collapsed table for a list of countries and their minimum payout amounts:

### Cross-border minimum payout amounts 

[Minimum amounts for cross-border payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cross-border-payouts/special-requirements.md#cbp-minimum-payout-amounts) are typically one base unit of the recipient account’s local currency, but can be higher. They don’t necessarily match the minimum amounts for regular payouts.

## Negative payouts 

Each payout reflects your available account balance at the time it was created. In some cases, you might have a negative account balance. For example, if you receive 100 USD in payments but refund 200 USD of prior payments, your account balance would be -100 USD. If you don’t receive further payments to balance out the negative amount, Stripe creates a payout that *debits* your bank account.

Your bank account must support both credit and debit transactions so that Stripe can perform any required payouts.

## Payout failures 

If your bank account can’t receive a payout for any reason, your bank sends the funds back to us. This returns an error with the [reason for the failure](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/failures.md). It can take up to 5 additional business days for your bank to return the payout and inform us that it failed. If this happens, you’re notified by email and in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payouts). To make sure that your bank account details are correct, you need to re-enter them if a payout fails. After you re-enter your bank account details, Stripe attempts to perform the payout again at the next scheduled payout interval.

> When a payout fails, it’s possible that its state initially shows as `paid` but then changes to `failed` (within 5 business days).

Make sure that the bank account information you provide is correct because Stripe sends the funds using the account information you enter. Therefore, if you provide incorrect information (for example, a mistyped account number or an incorrect routing number), Stripe might send payouts to the wrong bank account and might not be able to recover the funds.

Any fees or losses that you incur due to incorrect information fall under your responsibility. If your banking details are correct and the payout failure is for other reasons, contact your bank. After you resolve any issues with your bank, you can reactivate the payouts by clicking **Resume Payouts**. If you don’t receive a payout from Stripe after clicking **Resume Payouts**, and haven’t received a failure notification within a reasonable time frame, please [contact us](https://support.stripe.com/contact).

## Instant Payouts 

With [Instant Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts.md), you can instantly send funds to a supported debit card or bank account. You can request Instant Payouts any time, including weekends and holidays, and funds usually appear in the associated bank account within 30 minutes. New Stripe users aren’t immediately eligible for Instant Payouts. You can check your [eligibility](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts.md#eligibility-and-daily-volume-limits) in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payouts/instant_payouts_eligibility).

## Payout fees 

Stripe doesn’t charge you a fee to initiate normal payouts. However, most [non-primary currency payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/multicurrency-settlement.md), where you pay out money in a currency other than your Stripe account’s local currency, do incur Stripe fees.
