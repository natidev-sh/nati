# Nati â€” Getting Started

Welcome to Nati. This guide explains the core concepts so you can be productive quickly.

## Key concepts

- Apps: self-contained workspaces that bundle code, settings, and history.
- Chats: pair-programming sessions with AI to build and refactor.
- Hub: discover templates, prompts, and plugins (Stripe, Resend, and more).
- Configure: manage environment variables and provider keys per app.

## Quick steps

1. Create a new app from a template in the Hub.
2. Open Configure to add required API keys (e.g., `RESEND_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`).
3. Use the Preview panel to run, test, and publish.
4. Version panel helps you revert or branch changes.

## Tips

- Prefer test keys while iterating (Stripe test mode, Resend sandbox).
- Keep secrets in app-scoped env vars.
- Use the Docs page to quickly jump to provider guides.
