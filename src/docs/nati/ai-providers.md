# AI Providers

Comprehensive guide for integrating, managing, and optimizing multiple AI model providers.

---

## Overview

This document provides a complete overview of how to configure, manage, and safely use various AI providers within your app or infrastructure. It covers setup, API key management, performance tuning, cost control, and best practices for production environments.

---

## Providers

### OpenAI
- **Models**: GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-3.5-turbo.
- **Capabilities**: Text generation, structured output, embeddings, image generation, and audio transcription.
- **Notes**: GPT-4-turbo offers improved latency and pricing.

### Anthropic
- **Models**: Claude 3, Claude 3.5, Claude 3 Opus.
- **Capabilities**: Natural dialogue, long context (up to 200K tokens), and reasoning tasks.
- **Notes**: Best suited for document reasoning and summarization.

### Google (Gemini)
- **Models**: Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini Flash.
- **Capabilities**: Text, multimodal reasoning (image + text), and context up to 1M tokens.
- **Notes**: Gemini excels at retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large documents.

### Local Providers
- **Engines**: Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, or custom Docker backends.
- **Capabilities**: Offline inference, fine-tuning, custom embeddings, and latency control.
- **Notes**: Ideal for on-premises or privacy-critical deployments.

## API Keys

- Store keys in **Settings → Providers** or secure environment variables.
- Never commit keys to Git or public repositories.
- For team projects, rotate keys periodically and document their scopes.
- Prefer **organization-level keys** for shared environments.
- Validate keys on startup and surface detailed errors on invalid credentials.

### Key Storage Strategies

| Context | Recommended Method |
|----------|--------------------|
| Local development | `.env.local` file |
| CI/CD pipelines | Encrypted secrets (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) |
| Production servers | Environment variables or Vault integration |
| Desktop apps | OS keychain or encrypted local store |

---

## Regions & Latency

- Choose regions closest to your users to reduce latency and improve throughput.
- Some providers (like Anthropic or Google) restrict access based on compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).
- When possible, **cache embeddings or responses** to avoid repeated requests.

| Provider | Region Options | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| OpenAI | `us-east`, `eu-west` | Auto-routed by default |
| Anthropic | `us`, `eu` (limited) | Check compliance docs |
| Google | Global (multi-region) | Smart routing enabled |
| Local | Depends on deployment | Use LAN/IP-based routing |

---

## Rate Limits

- Each provider enforces **rate limits per key** (requests/minute or tokens/minute).
- Always handle `429 Too Many Requests` with **exponential backoff**.
- Log both success and throttled calls to monitor usage trends.

### Example: Backoff Strategy (Pseudocode)
```ts
for (let attempt = 0; attempt < 5; attempt++) {
  try {
    const res = await callModel();
    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    if (err.status === 429) await sleep(Math.pow(2, attempt) * 100);
    else throw err;
  }
}
```

## Safety & Cost

- **Guardrails**: Filter harmful, biased, or confidential outputs.
- **Validation**: Use schema validation for structured outputs (e.g., zod or JSON Schema).
- **Cost tracking**: Log token usage and set daily/monthly budgets.
- **Caching**: Store results of deterministic prompts to cut token costs.
- **Quota protection**: Automatically downgrade model usage (e.g., from GPT-4 to GPT-3.5) when reaching budget limits.

---

## Monitoring & Observability

- Track:
  - Token usage (input/output per request)
  - Latency per model
  - Error codes and retries
- Use tracing tools (e.g., OpenTelemetry) to visualize pipeline performance.
- Add logs for both success and failure cases.

### Recommended Metrics
| Metric | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `requests_total` | Count of requests sent |
| `tokens_used_total` | Sum of prompt + completion tokens |
| `latency_ms` | Response time |
| `error_rate` | % of failed calls |

---

## Architecture Recommendations

- Abstract provider logic behind a **ModelClient** interface.
- Implement fallback models for resiliency (e.g., switch to Claude if GPT-4 fails).
- Use caching layers for repeated queries.
- Support streaming for large outputs (especially with Claude or GPT-4-turbo).

```ts
interface ModelClient {
  generate(prompt: string, options?: any): Promise<string>;
  stream?(prompt: string, onData: (chunk: string) => void): Promise<void>;
}
```

---

## Compliance & Governance

- Respect data privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA).
- Use **data anonymization** when sending user information to third-party APIs.
- Review provider **data retention** policies — e.g., OpenAI’s enterprise endpoints don’t retain data by default.

### Compliance Checklist
- [ ] Store keys securely
- [ ] Anonymize user data before requests
- [ ] Log and rotate keys
- [ ] Monitor costs and quotas
- [ ] Implement retry & failover logic

---

## Advanced Topics

### Hybrid Inference
Run a mix of **cloud + local** models:
- Cloud → heavy reasoning tasks
- Local → embeddings, autocomplete, private inference

### Dynamic Routing
Auto-select provider/model based on task type, cost, or latency:
```ts
if (prompt.length > 10000) use("claude-3-opus");
else use("gpt-4o-mini");
```

### Multi-Model Ensembles
Combine outputs from multiple models to increase reliability and quality.

## Summary

A well-designed AI provider system is:
- Secure (no leaked keys or unvalidated outputs)
- Scalable (region-aware, cached, monitored)
- Resilient (with retry and fallback logic)
- Cost-efficient (budget and token-aware)

Always monitor, test, and document integrations — your AI infrastructure is only as reliable as its configuration.
